  "readme": "@includes\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nA library of sass mixins for the modern web. If you need it... @include it!\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThe current version (<span ng-bind=\"version\"></span>) of @includes is available as a npm package, a bower component or zip download.\r\n\r\n##### npm\r\n\r\n> npm install sass-includes\r\n\r\n##### Bower\r\n\r\n> bower install includes\r\n\r\n##### Download\r\n\r\nDownload is available on the [documentation website](http://dannyoz.github.io/documentation)\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n##### Sass 3.3\r\n\r\n@includes uses sass maps so sass version 3.3+ is required. See below for instructions on installing sass.\r\n\r\n**Linux**\r\n\r\nIf you're using a distribution of Linux, you'll need to install Ruby first. You can install Ruby through the apt package manager, rbenv, or rvm.\r\n\r\n> sudo su -c \"gem install sass\"\r\n\r\n**Windows**\r\n\r\nBefore you start using Sass you will need to install Ruby. The fastest way to get Ruby on your Windows computer is to use [Ruby Installer.](http://rubyinstaller.org/) It's a single-click installer that will get everything set up for you super fast.\r\n\r\nThe installer will also install a Ruby command line powershell application that will let you use the Ruby libraries.\r\n\r\n**Mac**\r\n\r\nIf you prefer the command line over an application then getting Sass set up is a fairly quick process. Sass has a Ruby dependency but if you're using a Mac, congratulations, Ruby comes pre-installed.\r\n\r\n**Install Sass**\r\n\r\n1.  **Open your Terminal or Command Prompt.** On the Mac the Terminal.app comes installed by default. It's located in your \"Utilities\" folder. On Windows, run `cmd`.\r\n\r\n2.  **Install Sass.** Ruby uses Gems to manage its various packages of code like Sass. In your open terminal window type:\r\n\r\n    > gem install sass\r\n\r\n    This will install Sass and any dependencies for you. It's pretty magical. If you get an error message then it's likely you will need to use the <span class=\"higlight\">sudo</span> command to install the Sass gem. It would look like:\r\n\r\n    > sudo gem install sass\r\n\r\n3.  **Double-check.** You should now have Sass installed, but it never hurts to double-check. In your terminal application you can type:\r\n\r\n    > sass -v\r\n\r\n    It should return <span class=\"highlight\">Sass 3.4.15</span>. Congratulations! You've successfully installed Sass.\r\n\r\n##### Compass\r\n\r\n@includes also depends on the compass ruby gem. Setting this up also requires ruby to be installed on your machine. Installation is simple via terminal/cmd:\r\n\r\n> gem install compass",
